SR&ED Consulting
================

We claim SR&ED tax credit for Canadian companies in the space of software engineering, manufacturing, medical, biotech, clean energy, environmental technology, and food processing. Claiming SR&ED is an uncertain process - you may not get the desired result, if your project doesn't meet CRA's eligibility criteria, you won't get a cash refund. This page aims to minimize the uncertainty by providing information & insights. For an in-depth analysis of your particular case, drop us a line at: info at wikimachine dot com

What is SR&ED
-------------

Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED), is a Canadian government's incentive program to provide cash refunds or tax credits for the cost incurred in developing new or improved products or processes. The Scientific Research usually take place in Universities and research institutes, while the Experimental Development mostly happen in the industry, in those for-profit corporations.

Each year, more than 3 billion Canadian Dollars are paid out to 20,000 Canadian companies, most of which are small and medium enterprises. A simple calculation shows that, on average, each company is paid $150,000 cash refunds. 

Below is a definition of SR&ED from the Income Tax Act, it is worth your time to read it through.

Scientific research and experimental development (SR&ED) is defined for income tax purposes in subsection 248(1) of the Income Tax Act as follows:

"ʽscientific research and experimental developmentʼ means systematic investigation or search that is carried out in a field of science or technology by means of experiment or analysis and that is

(a) basic research, namely, work undertaken for the advancement of scientific knowledge without a specific practical application in view,

(b) applied research, namely, work undertaken for the advancement of scientific knowledge with a specific practical application in view, or

(c) experimental development, namely, work undertaken for the purpose of achieving technological advancement for the purpose of creating new, or improving existing, materials, devices, products or processes, including incremental improvements thereto,

and, in applying this definition in respect of a taxpayer, includes

(d) work undertaken by or on behalf of the taxpayer with respect to engineering, design, operations research, mathematical analysis, computer programming, data collection, testing or psychological research, where the work is commensurate with the needs, and directly in support, of work described in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) that is undertaken in Canada by or on behalf of the taxpayer,

but does not include work with respect to

(e) market research or sales promotion,

(f) quality control or routine testing of materials, devices, products or processes,

(g) research in the social sciences or the humanities,

(h) prospecting, exploring or drilling for, or producing, minerals, petroleum or natural gas,

(i) the commercial production of a new or improved material, device or product or the commercial use of a new or improved process,

(j) style changes, or

(k) routine data collection;"

What is generally understood to be "research and development", or "R&D", is not necessarily "SR&ED". SR&ED is carried out in a certain way and for specific reasons. 

Who can Claim SR&ED
-------------------

You can claim SR&ED if:

1. You are a CCPC - Canadian Controlled Private Corporation;
2. You develop new product/process/technology, or improve existing product/process/technology;
3. You pay employees or subcontractors to develop technology;
4. Alternatively, you are an individual or a sole proprietor and you do 2 & 3 above;

There is no downside of claiming SR&ED, the worst you can get is a big fat rejection from CRA. No panelty, other than the man hours you spend preparing the claim;

If you are new to SR&ED, we do not recommend that you claim it all by yourself, it is not a rocket science but the learning curve is steep, and you have a business to take care. It is wise to engage a savvy SR&ED consultant to take care everything for you.

What are the Qualifying SR&ED Technologies
------------------------------------------

The program do not dictate any specific technology, in fact, any technology could qualify for SR&ED.

Just a few simple examples, more case study will be given for each vertical:

- If you are a food processor, developing a new process, new formulation, new ingredients can be a strong candidate of SR&ED project;

- If you are a health care provider, the clinic trials and data analytics for better health outcome is a good candidate of SR&ED project;

- If you are a metal working manufacturer, optimization of the process through experiments in feeds, speeds and cutting tools and tool coatings, is a good candidate of SR&ED project;

- If you are a chemical plant, reducing corrosion and premature equipment degradation can be a good candidate;

- If you are a mining company, natural resource reclamation, or mining process optimization can all be good candidates for SR&ED claims;

- If you are a manufacturer of energy products, such as LED light bulb, or you are an energy plant, any process to improve the efficiency of energy generation, reduce polution, increase heat dissipation, are good candidates for SR&ED claims;

- If you are a software developing company, any effort to make your software to perform faster, more stable, less CPU or memory intensive, more concurrency, more durability can be good candidates for SR&ED claim;

- If your development is associated with the buzz words like quantum computing, machine learning (artificial intelligence), cryptography, blockchain etc., you should consider claiming SR&ED tax credit for your projects;

How Do I Spot SR&ED Activities, If Any
--------------------------------------

Understand that, many of the technology developing activities are routine engineering, routine development, they may be hard but there are no uncertainties. The SR&ED program seek technological uncertainty, and you are conducting systematic search to reduce the uncertainty.

You need to spot your experimental development works, the works that go beyond the routine engineering. For example, if your engineers spend 85% of their time on routine development, and 15% on the challenging, experimental work where no prior art or engineering blueprint exist. That 15% works are the SR&ED activities you want to spot.

It is nice that your experimental work suceeded or achieved your desired goal, but it doesn't have to, even if your work failed or partially failed but you did gain more knowledge and insights through it, you can still claim for SR&ED.


What Proof Do I Need to Present
-------------------------------

You are required to keep all proof of your SR&ED activities, and you are obliged to present the proof to CRA on a short notice.

- Project planning documentation;
- Records of resources allocated to the project, time sheets;
- Design of experiments;
- Project records, laboratory notebooks;
- Design, system architecture and source code;
- Records of trial runs;
- Progress reports, minutes of project meetings;
- Test protocols, test data, analysis of test results, conclusions;
- Samples, prototypes, scraps, or other artifacts;


How Likely is My Claim Accepted
-------------------------------

It depends on how well your project description meet the SR&ED eligibility criteria. In this regard, having or not having a professional SR&ED consultant on your side often make or destroy a case. 

CRA has the "final" say if a project is eligible or not. In our experience CRA is quite reasonable when making eligibility decisions, they are obliged to follow their own criteria too. 

You can appeal CRA's decision, you can even challenge it in a court room if you feel you have a compelling reason. But it comes down to if your project meets the technological criteria defined in the SR&ED legislation. You should focus on the technological arguement - why it is uncertain, what systematic search did you perform, what experiments did you perform etc., there is no point making non-technological debate.
